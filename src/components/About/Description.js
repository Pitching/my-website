        <p class="lead text-start">I am a motivated full-stack web developer with a passion for programming and computer software & hardware. <br />
        As a former QA Analyst, I have developed a strong background in software testing and was exposed to automation <br />
        testing using python and selenium. I worked closely with Bell professionals and developers in agile and waterfall <br />
        methodologies, and have become very familiar with the software development lifecycle. Have served as a Sr. QA Analyst<br />
        to successfully deliver one of Bell's top 3 projects in 2020, in preparation for their new devices and modems to be<br />
        linked with their Maximo database. I aim to take what I have learned as a QA Analyst and apply that to my software <br />
        development mentality, finding and stopping bugs before they reach the test environment. Having experienced automation<br />
        testing, I found a true passion for programming and look to find a fulfilling role as a full-stack web developer where <br />
        I can grow my skills and contribute efficiently to something bigger.</p>
